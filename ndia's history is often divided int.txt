ndia's history is often divided into three phases: ancient, medieval, and modern. Each phase has its own variations, including kingdom, commercialization, and infrastructure development. Here are some key events in India's history:
Early humans
The earliest evidence of humans in South Asia dates back two million years. Anatomically modern humans first arrived on the Indian subcontinent between 73,000 and 55,000 years ago.
Indus Valley Civilization
Around 2600 B.C.E., regional cultures were united into a culturally integrated network that extended over a 650,000 square kilometer region.
Indo-Aryan culture
Around 1500, Indo-Aryan culture began to dominate the region and is associated with Sanskrit, a language related to Greek, Latin, and Avestan.
Vedic period
Hinduism emerged during the Vedic period, which is when the Indo-Aryans arrived and the Indus Valley developed.
Ancient kingdoms
The ancient kingdom of Magadha played an important role in the development of Jainism and Buddhism, and two of India's greatest empires, the Maurya Empire and Gupta Empire, originated from Magadha. These empires saw advances in ancient India's science, mathematics, astronomy, religion, and philosophy.
Mughal Empire
In the 16th century, the Mughal Empire conquered most of the Indian subcontinent, signaling the proto-industrialization and becoming the biggest global economy and manufacturing power.
Modern India
Modern India (AD 1857-1991) includes many significant events, such as the First War of Indian Independence (1857), the Formation of Indian National Congress (1885), the Partition of India (1947), and the New Economic Policy (1991)
